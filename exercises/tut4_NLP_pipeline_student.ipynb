    "So far we implemeneted (simplified version) of backpropagation in the 2. tutorial with a single weight, and a set of several weights (not weights matrices). Manually implementing backpropagation gives you full controll over the training process. However, the more complicated the architecture of the network is, the more difficult it would be to manually implement backprop. For this purpose, in the 3. tutorial we used the high-level api of keras, which is very simple and user-friendly: with several lines of code we trained and tuned our neural network. On the negative side, when using the high-level api, you have very little control over what is happening during the training process. Therefore, in this tutorial we will implement a manual training loop using tensorflow, which gives you more felxibility than the high-level api of keras and is not as code-intensive as manually implementing backprop. One of the advantages of building a manual training loop is that , among others, you can examine the flow of gradients during the training process. Keras provides an example implementation of such training loop: https://keras.io/guides/writing_a_training_loop_from_scratch/. Following the example online, and using the boston housing dataset from 3. tutorial or a dataset that you have simulated, implement manually the training loop. For simplicity reasons, you could use data consisting of single batch during the training process.  "

    "# NLP pipeline\n",
    "You are already familiar with building predictive models on tabular data. In tabular data, you have a feature matrix `X` and a target vector `Y`. Given these data structures, you can apply learning algorithms to learn the relationship between `X` and `Y`. In this exercise, you are provided with a data set of movie reviews. Your goal is to build a classifier predicting whether a review has a positive or negative tone (this task is called sentiment classification). Hence, you have a prediction problem with a binary target, `Y`, which is nothing new for you. However, in this exercise, what is new for you is that you need to deal with text data instead of tabular data. With text data, you need to process the data to obtain the required feature matrix `X`. This processing of data is what we call the \"NLP pipeline\". \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will need to set up an NLP pipeline. You are provided with a data set of movie reviews, where each sample contains a review (just a string cell). To obtain a feature matrix, each sample string cell needs to be transformed into a feature vector $x$. This process is called vectorization. There are multiple possible vectorization procedures. Today, you will implement a bag-of-words model for feature extraction. This feature extraction process involves two steps:\n",
    "1. Vocabulary building\n",
    " * Tokenization: Transforming a review, which is a single string at the beginning, into a vector of strings (tokens).\n",
    " * Cleaning and compressing techniques: Reducing the number of distinct tokens. E.g., correcting the misspelling of words or lower casing the letters prevents the same word from appearing in multiple spelling ways. Additionally, similar words (e.g. different forms of a verb) can be united into a single token. \n",
    " * Building a bag-of-words: a vector whose length corresponds exactly to the number of different tokens. Each token is assigned the position within the vector. \n",
    " \n",
    "2. Feature creation based on term frequency: Each review gets transformed into a feature vector $x$. The length of the feature vector corresponds to the length of the bag-of-words vector, created in step 1. An element $x_{j}$ of the feature vector is calculated by a frequency measure, measuring how frequently token $j$ from the bag-of-words vector occurs in the review. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first code cells provide the required packages and load the review data set, which you will use for the exercise. You will build the most simple NLP pipeline, which means that you go through steps 1 and 2 of the NLP pipeline, but you skip the \"cleaning and compressing\" part of step 1. This simple NLP pipeline provides you with a feature matrix `X` (possibly not ideal). You will use this feature matrix to build and evaluate a predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the tutorial, we will extend your NLP pipeline by including the cleaning and compressing techniques (according techniques are also covered in detail in the demo notebook `nlp_foundations.ipynb`). That will lead to another feature matrix, `X`. Then, we will build another predictive model on this new feature matrix `X` and compare the performance to the model built by the simplified NLP pipeline."

The basic idea of bag-of-words based feature extraction is to generate for each token in the vocabulary a column in the feature matrix `X`. For an observation $i$ (corresponding to a single review), the entry $X_{i,j}$ of the feature matrix would be 1 if the review contains the token of column $j$ and 0 otherwise. There are some variations to this approach, f.e., the Tfidf approach (*term frequency-inverse document frequency*), which we apply in this exercise. Have a look at the matrix, which the `TfidfVectorizer` created. "
